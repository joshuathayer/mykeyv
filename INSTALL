Getting a development / testing environment going:

get Sisyphus from github
get mykeyv fromgithub
install anyevent using your OS's package management tools
use CPAN to install everything in reqs/REQS in both sisyphus and mykev

create a mysql DB using the following recommended values:
db KeyValue
user KeyValue
password KeyValuePass

create db tables:
cat KEYVALUES | mysql -u KeyValue -pKeyValuePass -h localhost KeyValue

edit mykeyv/bin/kvd.pl to add the path to sisyphus/lib/ and mykeyv/lib/ to your perl lib path

configure your syslogd to allow network logging, on ubuntu:

in /etc/default/syslogd, uncomment:
SYSLOGD="-r"

in the mykeyv/bin directory, you should be able to run 
sudo ./runcluster kick
which will stop; start your cluster of kvd's

in the mykeyv/bin directory, you should be able to run
./clientUsingLib.pl ./clientConf.pl
which will test the installation
